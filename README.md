# Acrossim: A toolkit for cross-platform integration of CFD simulation data in computer graphics

Acrossim is a modular component-based toolkit to process and integrate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation data into game engines. The toolkit integrates data from the most commonly applied CFD solvers in engineering science; OpenFOAM, COMSOL and Ansys Fluent. The provided toolkit helps developers effortlessly bring any simulation content to user devices.

Details are available at developer documentation https://sersolmaz.github.io/Acrossim/.

The software is built on top of previously released code snippets from CFD_AR_VR (https://github.com/sersolmaz/CFD_AR_VR) to integrate CFD data in computer graphics.
