## Acrossim

Acrossim is a modular component-based toolkit to process and integrate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation data into game engines. The toolkit integrates data from most commonly applied CFD solvers in engineering science; OpenFOAM, COMSOL and Ansys Fluent. The provided toolkit helps developers to effortlessly bring any simulation content to user devices. You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/sersolmaz/Acrossim/edit/main/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content of the toolkit.

### Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Methodology

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sersolmaz/Acrossim/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Installation

An Anaconda environment should be compiled to run Acrossim with **acrossim.yml** file. Use the terminal or an Anaconda Prompt in Anaconda Navigator for the following steps:

1. Creat an environment from the **acrossim.yml** file. Make sure that the terminal and **acrossim.yml** are in the same working directory.
```markdown
conda env create -f acrossim.yml
```
2. Activate environment.
```markdown
conda activate acrossim
```
3. Verify the installed environment
```markdown
conda env list
```
