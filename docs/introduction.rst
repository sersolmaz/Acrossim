Introduction
============

Coherent structures and vortices sometimes are misunderstood for not having a 
clear definition. In general ways, any form of pattern arising in the flow that
has an effect on it is considered a coherent structure. Meanwhile, the vortices
are commonly explained as the existence of some kind of rotation in the flow.
The difficulty on identifying these vortices it's in the fact that is not so
clear to measure the extension of the vortex from its center of rotation.
All of this becomes more complicated when we have the interaction between
multiples coherent structures. According to Shawn *et al* (2005) [SHAWN2005]_
the definition is:

   "It is generally accepted that flows with general time dependence admit
   emergent patterns which influence the transport of tracers, those structures
   are often generically refered to as Coherent Structures"

In short we can say that vortices are one of the specific definition for
coherent structures.
